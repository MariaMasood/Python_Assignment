        "Q1 - Define Object Oriented Programming Language?\n",
        "Object-oriented programming is a paradigm or pattern of programming whereby the solution to a programming problem is modelled > as a collection of collaborating objects. Objects collaborate by sending messages to each other. It is most suitable for managing large, complex problems.\n",

        "A function is a piece of code that is called by name. It can be passed data to operate on (i.e. the parameters) and can optionally return data (the return value). All data that is passed to a function is explicitly passed.\n",

        "A method is implicitly passed the object on which it was called.\n",
        "A method is able to operate on data that is contained within the class (remembering that an object is an instance of a class - the class is the definition, the object is an instance of that data).\n",
